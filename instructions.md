##Instructions/Help

Read the general info first then the information regarding your team (HTML/JS).
Currently there is no one working on the HTML team (apart from me) so there is no need for any instructions ,yet.

###JavaScript
* Ignore the code at the start of the page, this is just to make sure the game starts when a button is clicked.
* Do NOT delete the `});` at the end of the file
* This means that no `confirm()` box is needed to ask the user when they are ready.
* The JavaScript team should only be coding on the `script.js` page 
* The `script.js` file has already been linked to so there is no need to worry about editing `game.html`
* For control flow, the `switch` statement is preferable.
* Make sure that each switch statement has a default branch with an error message.
* Use the function `.toLowerCase()` to convert all strings to lower case
* For example:
* `var choice1 = prompt("Do you like bacon?");`
* `if (choice1.toLowerCase === "yes") {document.write("Welcome")}`

* For the input, the prompt function shall be used.
* For example:
* `var choice1 = prompt("Do you run or hide?")`
* For outputting text, `document.write()` shall be used instead of `console.log()`.
* However, all questions shall be asked within the `prompt` or `confirm`.
* Where appropriate, `confirm()` boxes shall be used.

####Regarding the RPG itself:
* The game can be anything you want! Feel free to add puns, references etc.
