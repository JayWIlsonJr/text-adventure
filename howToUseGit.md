Welcome to the Git Tutorial
===========================
I will be showing you how to effectively use git for github.

**What is Git?**
Git is an older, command line tool that has now become more widely used due to the more recent creation of GitHub. You can think of it as a localised version of github, i.e the repositories are stored on your computer and nobody else can see or access them. It acts as a version control so if you mess up some file or you accidentally delete it then you can go back to a way that it was before. You can use it to make changes locally and then push them to github if you so wish. All the same basic actions on github are available locally via git, for example branches and commits. You should note that pulling on github is basically the opposite of pulling on git, but we will get into that some more later. For now, we will focus on installing git and I will explain more as we go along.
